INTRODUCTION
------------

Current Maintainer: Scot Hubbard - http://drupal.org/user/868214

This module  allows content creators/maintainers to add maps to content via
the addition of a "Google Map Field" field type that can be added to content
types.

Using the google map field, the user can drop a marker on a map, set the
width, height and zoom factor of the map and save the data for the map
with the node.

There are no geocoding facilities and the standard map controls are shown by
default (Zoom pan up/down/left/right, Map/Satelite). This may be enhanced to
include more controls in a future version.


INSTALLATION
------------

Install as usual...
see http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7


CONFIGURATION
-------------

There are no specific config options for this module.  To use it you simply
add the "Google Map Field" to the entity on which you wish to use it
(node/taxonomy term/user etc).


NOTES
-----

This module used to contain a WYSIWYG map feature.  This has been moved to its 
own module. Please see http://drupal.org/projects/wysiwyg_map
